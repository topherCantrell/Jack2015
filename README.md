# Jack2015

I have four bright neo-pixel plates and a couple of smaller LED grids. I might
as well put them to work in a Jack-O-Lantern this year.

The plan is to use the two smaller displays for eyes. Three of the plates will make a mouth. I'll offset them to better allow a smile. I'll use the center stripe of the fourth for a nose.

I already have the propeller software going. I was planning a Circuit Cellar article (of course) on the grid mapping. This project will be a good addition to the article.
